# WebGL BLAS
Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms using WebGL for accessible GPU computing

# info

After trying on multiple machines to setup CUDA/Caffe and breaking my laptop multiple times, I was pissed. Now this obviously can't touch the speed of handwritten GPU assembly, but what it can do is work for nearly everyone with a browser. I'm hoping once I get through this GLSL bog that my BLAS will be faster than the CPU version (which I'll be testing against), but until then I can only hope.

Progress: 1%
