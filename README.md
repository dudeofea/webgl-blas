# jsnn
async neural network using hebbian learning in javascript

# info

disclaimer: I mostly don't know what I'm doing. This is me trying some things out.

progress: About half way to realizing I'm a long ways away

What's missing:
- A way to scale back connections
- A way to represent "learning waves" (shifting calcium gradients that trigger outwards from neurons)
